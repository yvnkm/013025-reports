# Report 2: CGP Metrics Evaluated by CMS/Reimbursement

This report outlines the specific metrics and evidentiary standards used by CMS (specifically the MolDX program) to evaluate Comprehensive Genomic Profiling (CGP) tests for reimbursement.

## 1. Key Evaluation Metrics (The ACCE Framework)

MolDX uses the **ACCE Framework** (Analytical Validity, Clinical Validity, Clinical Utility, and ELSI) to determine if a test is "Reasonable and Necessary."

### A. Analytical Validity (AV): "Does the test measure what it claims to?"
CMS requires proof that the test is accurate, reliable, and reproducible in the laboratory setting.
*   **Key Metrics:**
    *   **1. Accuracy (Overall Concordance):** "How often is the test right?"
        *   **Formula:** $\frac{\text{TP} + \text{TN}}{\text{Total Positions Evaluated}}$
        *   *Note:* In NGS, this is dominated by True Negatives (TN) because most of the genome is normal. It is often >99.99% and less useful than PPA/NPA.
    *   **2. Sensitivity ($\approx$ PPA):** "If a mutation exists, do we find it?"
        *   **Formula:** $\frac{\text{TP}}{\text{TP} + \text{FN}}$
        *   **Numerator:** Variants found by BOTH your test and the Gold Standard.
        *   **Denominator:** All variants known to exist in the Gold Standard.
    *   **3. Specificity ($\approx$ NPA):** "If it's normal, do we call it normal?"
        *   **Formula:** $\frac{\text{TN}}{\text{TN} + \text{FP}}$
        *   **Numerator:** Positions called "Normal" by BOTH.
        *   **Denominator:** All positions known to be Normal in the Gold Standard.
    *   **4. Limit of Detection (LoD):** The lowest VAF (e.g., 5%) where Sensitivity is still >95%.
    *   **5. Precision:** Reproducibility (Inter-run/Intra-run).

### B. Clinical Validity (CV): "Does the result correlate with a disease state?"
CMS requires proof that the genetic variants detected are clinically meaningful.
*   **Requirement:** The test must detect variants that are:
    *   Known "drivers" of the disease.
    *   Predictive of therapy response (e.g., *EGFR* mutations for Osimertinib).
    *   Prognostic of outcomes.
*   **Evidence:** Citations from peer-reviewed literature or guidelines (NCCN, ASCO) linking specific variants to specific cancer types. *Note: "Pan-Cancer" claims require validation across multiple representative tumor types.*

### C. Clinical Utility (CU): "Does using the test improve patient care?"
This is the **hardest hurdle**. CMS will only pay if the test result actively changes medical management.
*   **Requirement:**
    *   The test must guide a physician to a specific therapy, clinical trial, or palliative care decision.
    *   Evidence that testing leads to better health outcomes compared to *not* testing (or using standard single-gene tests).
*   **Exclusion:** "Curiosity" testing (informational only) is **not covered**.

## 2. Data Requirements & Acquisition

To get paid, a lab must go through the **MolDX Technical Assessment (TA)** process.

### Required Data Dossier
1.  **Validation Summary Report:** A comprehensive internal document detailing the AV study (samples used, method, results).
    *   *Sample Size:* Guidelines often suggest **>59 samples** representative of the tumor types and variant classes being tested.
2.  **Sample-Level Data:** Excel spreadsheets showing the raw comparison of the test vs. the reference method (Gold Standard) for every sample.
3.  **Clinical Evidence:** A bibliography or clinical study summary demonstrating CV and CU.
4.  **SOPs:** Standard Operating Procedures for the wet lab and bioinformatics pipeline.

### Acquisition Methods
*   **Internal Validation Study:** The lab must run known samples (cell lines + clinical samples confirmed by another method) to generate the AV data.
*   **Clinical Studies/Trials:** For Clinical Utility, labs often rely on existing literature (Level 1 Evidence) or must run their own prospective/retrospective utility study if the test is novel.

## 3. Timeline for Reimbursement

The process is lengthy and distinct from FDA approval.

| Step | Action | Estimated Time |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **1. Z-Code Application** | Register test with the DEX Diagnostics Exchange to get a Z-Code identifier. | **~2 Weeks** |
| **2. Technical Assessment (TA)** | Submit the full dossier (AV/CV/CU data) to MolDX for review. | **~3-4 Weeks** (Standard)<br>**~60 Days** (Complex/Additional Info needed) |
| **3. Coverage Determination** | MolDX determines if the test meets LCD (Local Coverage Determination) criteria. | Variable (Concurrent with TA) |
| **4. Pricing/Gapfill** | CMS determines the payment rate (if no existing code fits). | Annual Cycle (Summer/Fall) |

**Total Estimated Time:** From validation completion to first paid claim ~ **3 to 6 months** (best case), assuming the test falls under an existing LCD policy.

**Key Note:** The Z-code is mandatory. Without it, claims will be automatically rejected.
