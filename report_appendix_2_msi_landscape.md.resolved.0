# Appendix 2: The MSI-High Landscape (Drugs & CDx)

## 1. The Blockbuster Drugs (The "Prize")
Capturing MSI-High patients unlocks access to **immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI)**, which have some of the most dramatic response rates in oncology.

*   **Keytruda (Pembrolizumab):** The massive "Pan-Cancer" approval. Any solid tumor that is MSI-H is eligible.
*   **Jemperli (Dostarlimab):** Famous for the "100% cure rate" clinical trial in Rectal Cancer; also approved for Endometrial Cancer.
*   **Opdivo (Nivolumab) + Yervoy:** Approved specifically for MSI-H Colorectal Cancer.

## 2. The Current CDx (Your Competition)
Doctors have three imperfect options to find these patients. WGS competes mainly with #1 and #2.

| Method | The Player | How It Works | The Flaw (WGS Opportunity) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **NGS Panel** | **FoundationOne CDx** | Extracts MSI score from the panel data. | **Low Sensitivity:** Looks at hundreds of loci. WGS looks at millions, offering superior sensitivity for "low-instability" tumors. |
| **PCR** | **Promega** / Idylla | The historical "Gold Standard" (5 specifically chosen loci). | **CRC Bias:** Built for Colon Cancer. Often fails in Endometrial/Prostate/Gastric cancer because it looks at the *wrong* 5 loci. |
| **IHC** | **Ventana** (Roche) | Stains tissue slides to see if MMR proteins are missing. | **Workflow Silo:** It's cheap/fast but requires a separate Pathology order. It cannot be "bundled" into a genomic report easily. |

## 3. Strategic Opportunity
**The Win:** Replace the specific PCR test and the limited Panel test with **Universal MSI**.
*   *Pitch:* "Why run a separate PCR test (that might fail in non-CRC) or a limited Panel? WGS provides the most sensitive, universal MSI score automatically."
