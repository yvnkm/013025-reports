# Cancer Detection Research Implementation Plan

## Goal Description
The user wants three detailed reports covering:
1.  **HRD Score Calculation:** Methodologies across Panel, WES, and WGS, including limitations and cutoffs.
2.  **CGP Reimbursement:** Metrics evaluated by CMS for reimbursement, required data, acquisition methods, and timelines.
3.  **Genomic Drug Prescription:** How drugs with genomic indications are prescribed safely without specific companion diagnostics (CDx), focusing on LDT CGP and PCR.

## Proposed Research Strategy

### Report 1: HRD Score Methodologies
- **Research Focus:** Compare Panel, WES, and WGS approaches to identifying LOH, TAI, and LST.
- **Key Data Points:**
    - Calculation formulas/algorithms (e.g., scarHRD, myriad algos).
    - Platform-specific limitations (e.g., backbone density for panels, noise for WES).
    - Standard cutoffs (e.g., Myriad's 42, potential WGS-specific scores).

### Report 2: CGP Reimbursement Metrics (CMS)
- **Research Focus:** MolDX and CMS guidelines (LCDs/NCDs) for NGS-based cancer testing.
- **Key Data Points:**
    - **Analytical Validity:** Accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, LoD.
    - **Clinical Validity:** Association of variants with clinical outcomes.
    - **Clinical Utility:** How the test improves patient management.
    - **Data/Timeline:** Tech stacks (AV validation reports), clinical studies, and typical review durations (e.g., MolDX J-code timelines).

### Report 3: Drug Prescription Without CDx
- **Research Focus:** Regulatory and clinical pathways for "off-label" or "non-CDx" use of targeted therapies.
- **Key Data Points:**
    - FDA labeling language (e.g., "FDA-approved test" vs. specific CDx).
    - Role of Lab Developed Tests (LDTs) and CLIA/CAP validation.
    - Situations requiring orthogonal confirmation (e.g., PCR, Sanger).
    - NCCN guidelines role in supporting LDT-based prescriptions.

## Output Format
- Three distinct markdown reports saved in the workspace.
- Clear headings, comparative tables, and cited sources (where possible).
