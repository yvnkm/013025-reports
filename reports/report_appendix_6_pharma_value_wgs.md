# Appendix 6: Why Pharma Buys WGS Data (The "Dark Matter" Value)

You asked: *"Would pharma be more interested in WGS data than WES or Panel?"*
**Answer:** **YES.** Pharma is saturated with Panel data. They are starving for WGS data.

## 1. The "Negative Data" Problem
*   **Panel Reality:** If a panel says "KRAS Negative", it only means "No KRAS mutation found *in the exons we looked at*."
*   **Pharma Need:** Pharma needs to know *why* the patient didn't respond to the KRAS inhibitor.
*   **WGS Solution:** WGS finds the **Deep Intronic** or **Promoter** mutations (e.g., TERT promoter) that act as resistance mechanisms.
*   **Value:** WGS provides the *definitive* reason for drug failure. Panel data leaves them guessing.

## 2. The "Signature" Gold Mine (HRD & Mutational Signatures)
*   **The Trend:** New drugs (PARP inhibitors, ATR inhibitors) target **DNA Damage Response (DDR)** mechanisms, not just single genes.
*   **The Gap:** Signatures (like SBS3 for HRD) require broad, genome-wide patterns to be calculated accurately.
*   **WGS Value:** WGS provides the "High Definition" view of these signatures.
    *   *Example:* A panel estimates HRD from 3,000 SNPs. WGS calculates it from **3,000,000 SNPs**. Pharma pays a premium for the cleaner signal.

## 3. "Future-Proofing" the Cohort (The Time Machine)
*   **The Scenario:** In 2026, Pharma invents a drug targeting a "Junk DNA" region (non-coding RNA).
*   **Panel Data:** USELESS. That region wasn't sequenced.
*   **WGS Data:** VALUABLE. The region is there. Pharma can query your 2024 database to find patients *today* for their 2026 drug.
*   **The Deal:** This allows for "Retrospective biomarker discovery" deals, where you license the *same* dataset multiple times for different targets.
