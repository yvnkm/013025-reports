# Appendix 5: Monetizing the WGS Advantage (Beyond CDx)

You asked: *"Having more information is not always good (it's noise). How do we get money out of it?"*
**Answer:** You don't sell the noise to the *doctor*. You sell the signal to *Pharma*.

## 1. The "Trial Matching" Engine (Revenue from Hospitals)
*   **The Problem:** Hospitals lose money when trials fail to recruit. Panels miss 20-30% of eligible patients because they don't test for rare biomarkers (e.g., NRG1 fusions, specific exon skipping).
*   **The WGS Play:** WGS finds *every* potential trial candidate.
*   **Monetization:**
    *   **Per-Patient-Match Fee:** Charge the Pharma sponsor $5,000 - $10,000 for identifying a patient for their rare disease trial.
    *   *Pitch:* "Your Panel missed this NRG1 fusion patient. Our WGS found them. That's a $10k finder's fee."

## 2. The "Real World Data" (RWD) License (Revenue from Pharma)
*   **The Problem:** Pharma has plenty of EGFR/KRAS data. They are desperate for **negative data** and **co-mutational data** to understand resistance mechanisms.
*   **The WGS Play:** WGS captures the *entire* landscape, including non-coding drivers and complex signatures that panels miss.
*   **Monetization:**
    *   **Data Licensing:** De-identified genomic + clinical data deals (e.g., Roche bought Flatiron for $1.9B mainly for this).
    *   *Value:* WGS data is "Premium Tier" compared to Panel data because it includes the "Dark Matter" of the genome where the next blockbuster targets live.

## 3. "Lifetime" Re-Analysis (Revenue from Payers/Patients)
*   **The Problem:** Panels expire. If a new gene is discovered next year, the panel results from today are useless. The patient needs a new biopsy.
*   **The WGS Play:** The genome doesn't change.
*   **Monetization:**
    *   **Subscription Model:** Offer a "Lifetime Re-analysis" service.
    *   *Scenario:* In 2026, a new drug targets *KRAS G12D* in a way previously thought impossible.
    *   *Action:* You query your WGS database, find 500 past patients, and notify their doctors immediately. No new lab work. Just software.
