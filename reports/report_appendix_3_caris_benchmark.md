# Appendix 3: The $8,000 Caris Benchmark (ADLT Strategy)

## 1. How Caris Gets ~$8,000
Caris Life Sciences achieves a premium reimbursement of **~$8,000** (specifically ~$8,455 for CY2025) not by using standard CPT codes, but by securing a **Proprietary Laboratory Analyses (PLA)** code and achieving **Advanced Diagnostic Laboratory Test (ADLT)** status.

### The "Magic" Code: 0211U
*   **Code:** **0211U**
*   **Description:** Oncology (pan-tumor), DNA and RNA by NGS, 437 genes (or more), DNA/RNA analysis (WES/WTS).
*   **2025 Medicare Rate:** **$8,455**

## 2. The Strategy: How They Did It
You cannot get this price with a standard code (like 81455 for ~50 genes, which pays ~$2,900). You must follow the **ADLT Roadmap**.

### Step 1: PLA Code (Differentiation)
Caris applied for a specific PLA code (0211U) to distinguish their test from generic panels.
*   *Why:* Generic codes (81445, 81455) are "Crosswalked" to lower rates. A specific code allows for a specific price.

### Step 2: FDA Approval (The Golden Ticket)
Caris obtained FDA approval for **MI Cancer Seek™** as a Companion Diagnostic (CDx).
*   *Why:* FDA approval is the "Fast Pass" to **ADLT Status**.
*   *Rule:* CMS grants ADLT status automatically to FDA-cleared/approved tests that are unique to a single lab.

### Step 3: ADLT Designation (The Price Lock)
Once designated as an ADLT (New ADLT), CMS follows a unique payment rule:
1.  **First 9 Months (The Bonus):** CMS pays the **Actual List Charge** (whatever Caris says the price is).
2.  **After 9 Months (The Market Rate):** CMS pays the **Weighted Median of Private Payer Rates**.
    *   *Strategy:* Caris negotiates high rates with private insurers first. When CMS switches to the "Market Rate," that rate remains high (~$8,455) because the private contracts supports it.

## 3. The Blueprint for WGS
To replicate Caris's success with a WGS product:
1.  **Do NOT use 81425** (Genome sequence, ~3000 dollars).
2.  **Apply for a PLA Code** specifically for your WGS+RNA assay.
3.  **Get FDA Approval** (even for a limited indication) to trigger ADLT status.
4.  **Set High Private Rates** to establish the "Market Rate" floor before the CMS data collection period.
