# Appendix 4: The Sequencing Cost Outlook (The "Crossover Point")

## 1. The Current Landscape (2025)
The cost of raw sequencing (Cost of Goods Sold - COGS) is crashing, driven by a new "arms race" between Illumina, Ultima, and Element.

| Platform | Cost per Gb | Cost per 30x Genome (Raw) | The Play |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Illumina NovaSeq X** | ~$2.00 - $3.00 | ~$200 - $300 | The Incumbent. High throughput, proven chemistry. |
| **Element AVITI** | ~$2.00 | ~$200 | The "Dark Horse". Extremely high quality (Q40), lower instrument cost. |
| **Ultima Genomics (UG100)** | **~$1.00** (Target $0.80) | **~$100** | **The Disruptor.** Sacrifices some read length for sheer volume. |

## 2. The "Crossover Point" (WGS vs. Panel)
The central economic argument for WGS is that it will soon be **cheaper** than running a Panel.

### The Math:
*   **Panel COGS:** ~$300 - $500 (High labor, probes, complex library prep).
*   **WGS COGS (Today):** ~$400 - $500 (Mostly sequencing cost).
*   **WGS COGS (2026/Ultima):** **<$200**

### The Insight
WGS has **Zero** Capture Probes and **Zero** Capture Labor.
*   Panels are "Labor Heavy" (Manual steps to pull out genes).
*   WGS is "Machine Heavy" (Just dump DNA into the sequencer).
*   *As sequencing costs drop (Moore's Law), WGS becomes cheaper because machines get cheaper faster than human labor.*

## 4. The 60x "Somatic" Reality
You asked: *"Is it still cheaper if I run 60x (Somatic Standard) instead of 30x?"*
**Answer:** Yes, but the margin is tighter. It depends heavily on the sequencer.

### The Math (60x WGS = ~200 Gb)
*   **Panel COGS (Fixed):** **~$400** (Labor + Probes + Extraction).
    *   *Note: Panel cost is labor-dominated, so it doesn't get much cheaper.*

*   **60x WGS COGS (Variable):**
    *   **On NovaSeq X ($2.50/Gb):** $500 seq + $50 prep = **$550** (More expensive than Panel).
    *   **On Element ($2.00/Gb):** $400 seq + $50 prep = **$450** (Comparable).
    *   **On Ultima ($1.00/Gb):** $200 seq + $50 prep = **$250** (**Cheaper than Panel**).

### Strategic Takeaway
At **60x**, WGS beats Panels purely on price **ONLY IF** you use the new ultra-low-cost sequencers (Ultima).
If you use legacy machines (NovaSeq 6000), 60x WGS is still ~2x more expensive than a panel. This is why **technology choice** is critical for your winning strategy.
