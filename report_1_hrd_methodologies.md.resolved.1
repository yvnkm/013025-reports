# Report 1: HRD Score Calculation Methodologies (Panel, WES, WGS)

**Key Clinical Indications:**
HRD testing is primarily indicated for **Ovarian Cancer** (predicting PARP inhibitor response, e.g., Olaparib, Niraparib). It is also increasingly used in **Breast Cancer** (TNBC), **Prostate Cancer** (Metastatic Castration-Resistant), and **Pancreatic Cancer**, where homologous recombination defects are common.

This report details how Homologous Recombination Deficiency (HRD) scores are calculated across different sequencing platforms, their specific limitations, and the standard cutoffs used for clinical interpretation.

## 1. HRD Score Calculation Methodologies

The HRD score is typically a composite metric derived from three specific types of "genomic scars" that accumulate when the homologous recombination repair pathway is defective.

$$ \text{HRD Score} = \text{LOH} + \text{TAI} + \text{LST} $$

| Metric | Definition | Calculation Criteria |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **LOH** (Loss of Heterozygosity) | Regions where one parental allele is missing. | Count of LOH regions **>15 Mb** but shorter than the whole chromosome. |
| **TAI** (Telomeric Allelic Imbalance) | Imbalance in gene copies at chromosome ends. | Count of regions with allelic imbalance extending to the **sub-telomere**, excluding those covering the centromere. |
| **LST** (Large-scale State Transitions) | Drastic switches in DNA structure between adjacent regions. | Count of chromosomal breakpoints between adjacent regions of at least **10 Mb** (after filtering small regions <3 Mb). |

### Platform-Specific Approaches

#### A. Targeted Panels (CGP)
*   **Method:** Relies on a "SNP Backbone". Since panels only sequence specific genes (e.g., 500 cancer genes), they must be custom-designed with thousands of extra SNP probes spread evenly across the genome (e.g., 20,000 - 54,000 SNPs).
*   **Process:**
    1.  **Backbone SNPs:** Measure Allele Frequency at these discrete points.
    2.  **Segmentation:** Algorithms "connect the dots" between SNPs to infer continuous blocks of LOH, TAI, or LST.
    3.  **Scoring:** Counts are derived from these inferred segments.

> [!NOTE]
> **Toy Example: How SNPs Infer LOH**
> Imagine a Chromosome as a long string.
> *   **Normal (Heterozygous):** At any random SNP, you have 50% Mom's allele (A) and 50% Dad's allele (B).
>     *   SNP1: AB (50/50), SNP2: AB, SNP3: AB, SNP4: AB...
> *   **Loss of Heterozygosity (LOH):** Dad's copy is deleted.
>     *   SNP1: A (100/0), SNP2: A (100/0), SNP3: A (100/0)...
>
> **Inference:** Even if there is empty space between SNP1 and SNP2, seeing a string of "100/0" results allows the computer to infer that the *entire block* between them is LOH. If that block is >15 million bases long, it adds **+1** to the HRD score.

*   **Example Assays:** Myriad myChoice CDx, FoundationFocus CDxBRCA (LOH only), Illumina TruSight Oncology 500 (TSO500), AmoyDx HRD Complete.

#### B. Whole Exome Sequencing (WES)
*   **Method:** Sequences all protein-coding regions (exons), covering ~1-2% of the genome.
*   **Process:** Uses off-target reads and exon SNP data to estimate CNV and HRD.
    *   **Off-Target Reads:** In WES, ~30-50% of the sequencing reads accidentally miss the exon targets and land in the "empty" spaces. Instead of throwing these away, algorithms treat them as "low-resolution Whole Genome Sequencing" (like 0.1x - 0.5x coverage).
    *   **CNV Estimation:** By combining high-depth exon data with these low-depth off-target reads, the software generates "bins" across the genome to estimate copy number changes.
*   **CNV -> HRD:** Once the CNV profile (segmentation) involves the whole genome, the standard LOH/TAI/LST counts can be calculated, though usually with more noise than WGS.
*   **Algorithm:** Tools like **scarHRD** or **HRProfiler** are used to analyze segmented CNV data derived from WES.

#### C. Whole Genome Sequencing (WGS)
*   **Method:** Sequences the entire genome (coding and non-coding), providing a continuous view without gaps.
*   **Process:** Directly detects structural variants and copy number changes with high resolution.
*   **Algorithm:**
    *   **Standard:** Calculates LOH+TAI+LST directly with high precision.
    *   **Advanced Classifiers:** Can use machine learning models (e.g., **CHORD**, **HRDetect**) that look at complex mutational signatures (like deletions with microhomology) rather than just the simple 3-scar count.

## 2. Limitations by Platform

| Platform | Limitations | Impact on HRD Score |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Panel** | **Gaps/Resolution:** "Connecting the dots" can miss small events or misjudge breakpoint locations if they fall between SNP probes.<br>**Design Requirement:** Cannot use a standard gene-only panel; requires a specific high-density SNP backbone (20k-50k+ SNPs). | **Estimation Error:** Accuracy depends entirely on SNP density. Low-density backbones lead to false negatives or inaccurate LST counts. |
| **WES** | **Missing Data:** Exons are clustered; vast non-coding regions are empty, making structural variant detection (LST) difficult.<br>**Noise:** PCR amplification bias can make allele imbalance signals (necessary for LOH/TAI) broader and harder to call.<br>**Signatures:** Cannot detect specific "rearrangement signatures" (RS3, RS5) used by advanced algorithms like HRDetect. | **Reduced Sensitivity:** Often has lower correlation with "gold standard" array/WGS data for LST and TAI components. Higher false positive rate for CNVs. |
| **WGS** | **Cost & Data:** Significantly more expensive ($600-$1000+) and generates massive data (100GB+), requiring substantial compute.<br>**Purity Dependence:** Like all methods, relies on tumor purity; low purity (<20-30%) makes it hard to distinguish somatic variants from germline noise. | **Gold Standard:** Provides the most accurate, gap-free map of genomic scars. Limitations are primarily logistical/financial, not technical accuracy. |

## 3. Standard Cutoffs

There is no universal consensus, but specific assays have regulatory-approved cutoffs.

| Assay / Context | Cutoff for HRD Positive | Notes |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Myriad myChoice CDx** | **$\geq$ 42** | The FDA-approved "Gold Standard" for ovarian cancer (PAOLA-1, PRIMA trials). Includes *BRCA* mutation as HRD+ regardless of score. |
| **FoundationOne CDx** | **$\geq$ 16 (LOH only)** | Older metric (LOH-high). Note: Foundation now often reports genomic loss of heterozygosity (gLOH) percentage. |
| **AmoyDx HRD Complete** | **$\geq$ 50** | Proprietary cutoff used in their specific algorithm (GSS - Genomic Scar Score). |
| **Ovarian Cancer Research** | **$\geq$ 33** | Some newer academic studies (e.g., VELIA trial) suggest a lower cutoff (33) may capture more responders than 42. |
| **Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer** | **$\geq$ 31** | Suggested in some specific NSCLC studies. |
| **WGS (CHORD Classifier)** | **Probability Score** | Advanced WGS classifiers (like CHORD) often output a probability (e.g., >0.5) rather than a simple sum count of 42. |

**Key Takeaway:** The "Score of 42" is the most widely recognized clinical benchmark, specifically derived from the Myriad algorithm. Other platforms often calibrate their scores to match this "Myriad-42" scale or establish their own independent clinical validity studies.
