# Report 4: OncoKB FDA-Approved CDx Analysis (Updated)

## 1. Executive Summary
This report analyzes the **Level 1 (FDA-Approved)** therapeutic indications from the OncoKB database to determine the current state of Companion Diagnostic (CDx) coverage.
*Update Note:* This report incorporates the 8 FDA-approved CDx indications for Caris Life Sciences (MI Cancer Seek).

*   **Total FDA-Approved Indications Analyzed:** 203
*   **Indications WITH CDx:** 114 (56.2%)  *(Previously 54.2%)*
*   **Indications WITHOUT CDx:** 89 (43.8%)

**Key Finding:** Including Caris's recent broad approvals (MSI-High, EGFR, KRAS/NRAS/BRAF in CRC, etc.) increased the explicit CDx coverage by ~2%. Approximately **44%** of indications still lack a designated commercial CDx, mainly in blood cancers and older therapies.

## 2. Cancer Types: CDx Coverage Champions vs. Gaps

### Top Cancer Types by CDx Coverage (Rich in CDx)
After updating Caris's indications (especially for CRC and NSCLC), coverage metrics improved.

| Cancer Type | Total Indications | With CDx | % Covered |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Melanoma** | 7 | 7 | **100.0%** |
| **Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC)** | 37 | 30 | **81.1%** |
| **All Solid Tumors** (Tissue Agnostic) | 12 | 9 | **75.0%** |
| **Peritoneal Serous Carcinoma/Ovarian** | 8 | 6 | **75.0%** |
| **Colorectal Cancer** | 14 | 10 | **71.4%** |
| **Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML)** | 9 | 6 | **66.7%** |
| **Prostate Cancer** | 32 | 20 | **62.5%** |
| **Breast Cancer** | 19 | 11 | **57.9%** |

### Cancer Types Lacking CDx (The "CDx Desert")
Coverage remains zero for several hematologic malignancies and rare tumors.

| Cancer Type | Total Indications | With CDx | Notes |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **B-Lymphoblastic Leukemia/Lymphoma** | 5 | **0** | Rely on cytogenetics/FISH (non-commercial kits). |
| **Esophagogastric Adenocarcinoma** | 3 | **0** | |
| **Pediatric-Type Diffuse High-Grade Glioma** | 3 | **0** | |
| **APL with PML-RARA** | 3 | **0** | |

## 3. Drug Analysis: Which Drugs Have Mandated CDx?

### Top Drugs with High CDx Coverage
Caris's inclusion solidifies coverage for common targeted therapies.

| Drug | Total Indications | With CDx | % Covered |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Olaparib** (PARP Inhibitor) | 16 | 16 | **100%** |
| **Rucaparib** (PARP Inhibitor) | 4 | 4 | **100%** |
| **Afatinib** (EGFR TKI) | 4 | 4 | **100%** |
| **Entrectinib** (NTRK/ROS1) | 4 | 4 | **100%** |
| **Sotorasib** (KRAS G12C) | 2 | 2 | **100%** |

### Top Drugs Lacking CDx Links
No change for these drugs as they generally lack any approved CDx kit.

| Drug | Total Indications | No CDx | Possible Reason |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Talazoparib + Enzalutamide** | 12 | **12** | Recent combination approvals. |
| **Imatinib** (Gleevec) | 7 | 6 | Older "gold standard" drug (cytogenetics). |
| **Revumenib** | 4 | 4 | |
| **Repotrectinib** | 4 | 4 | |

## 4. Conclusion
*   **Caris Impact:** Adding Caris MI Cancer Seek expanded verified CDx coverage for **Breast (PIK3CA)**, **CRC (KRAS/NRAS/BRAF)**, and **NSCLC (EGFR)**.
*   **Solid Tumor Dominance:** The top 5 cancer types for CDx coverage are all solid tumors (Melanoma, Lung, Ovarian, CRC, Prostate).
*   **Hematology Gap:** While AML has some coverage (FLT3/IDH), other leukemias (ALL, CML) largely lack commercial companion diagnostic kits in this registry.
