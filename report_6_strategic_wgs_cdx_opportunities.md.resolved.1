# Report 6: Strategic Opportunities for WGS-based CDx

## 1. Executive Summary
This strategy report identifies the highest-value Indications for a new Whole Genome Sequencing (WGS) product.
The recommendation is based on **Unmet Clinical Needs** identified in our OncoKB analysis (where CDx coverage is 0%) and the **Intrinsic Strengths of WGS** (Structural Variants, Copy Number, and Genome-wide Scarring).

### Top 3 Recommended Focus Areas:
1.  **"Fusion Hunter" (Tissue Agnostic):** Targeting rare, cryptic fusions (NTRK, NRG1, FGFR) where panels fail.
2.  **"Universal HRD" (Ovarian/Prostate/Pancreatic):** Replacing proprietary panel scores with a superior genome-wide scar analysis.
3.  **"One-Stop Heme" (Leukemias):** Replacing the Cytogenetics + FISH + Panel triad with a single WGS assay.

## 2. Opportunity A: The "Fusion Hunter" (Tissue Agnostic)
**The Gap:** 32 FDA-approved Fusion indications (e.g., NTRK, NRG1, FGFR) currently lack a specific CDx kit in the OncoKB dataset.
**Why Patterns Fail:** Panels only cover "known" breakpoints or "suspected" partners. Intronic breakpoints (NTRK3) are massive (>50kb) and often missed by DNA amplicon panels.
**Why WGS Wins:**
*   **Intronic Coverage:** WGS covers the entire intron, ensuring no breakpoint is missed.
*   **Novel Partners:** Detects fusions promiscuously regardless of the partner gene (unlike panels requiring specific probes).
*   **Structural Resolution:** Can distinguish between functional fusions and complex rearrangements.

**Target Indications:**
*   **NTRK1/2/3:** Tissue-agnostic (Larotrectinib/Entrectinib). *High value, hard to detect.*
*   **NRG1 Fusions:** Pancreatic & Lung (Zenocutuzumab). *Massive introns, notoriously hard for panels.*
*   **FGFR2/3 Fusions:** Cholangiocarcinoma & Bladder Cancer.

## 3. Opportunity B: "Universal HRD" (Ovarian, Prostate, Pancreatic)
**The Gap:** Current CDx (Myriad myChoice) is a specific, proprietary microarray/panel assay.
**Why panels are limited:** They rely on SNP backbones that may be sparse.
**Why WGS Wins:**
*   **Resolution:** Millions of SNPs for LOH analysis vs. thousands in panels.
*   **Algorithm:** WGS can calculate LOH, TAI, and LST (the 3 components of HRD) with superior precision.
*   **Mechanism Agnostic:** Can detect "HRD Signature" even if the causative BRCA mutation is epigenetic or cryptic.

**Target Indications:**
*   **Ovarian Cancer:** First-line maintenance (PARPi).
*   **Prostate Cancer:** Metastatic Castration-Resistant (mCRPC).
*   **Pancreatic Cancer:** Platinum sensitivity prediction.

## 4. Opportunity C: "One-Stop Heme" (Leukemias)
**The Gap:** Our analysis showed **0% CDx coverage** for B-cell ALL, CML, and APL.
**Current Standard:** A fragmented workflow of **Karyotyping** (whole genome low res), **FISH** (targeted SVs), and **Panel** (SNVs like FLT3).
**Why WGS Wins:**
*   **Replacement Strategy:** A single WGS test can technically replace Karyotype (CNVs/SVs) + FISH (Fusions) + Panels (SNVs).
*   **Speed:** One workflow instead of three sequential tests.

**Target Indications:**
*   **Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML):** Complex Karyotype is a key prognostic marker.
*   **B-Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL):** Driven by structural variants (BCR-ABL1, ETV6-RUNX1).
*   **Multiple Myeloma:** Highly complex structural landscape suitable for WGS.

## 5. Opportunity D: The "True TMB" (Precision Play)
**The Status Quo:** TMB-High (>=10 mut/Mb) is an FDA-approved biomarker for Pembrolizumab in all solid tumors. Use is dominated by **FoundationOne CDx**.
**The Technical Flaw:** Panel-based TMB is an **extrapolation**.
*   F1CDx measures ~0.8 Mb of the genome.
*   To get "Mutations per Megabase", it multiplies the found count.
*   **The Sampling Error:** At the critical decision point (10 mut/Mb), panels have high variance. A patient with true TMB of 9 could read as 12 (False Positive) or vice versa.

**Why WGS Wins (Clinical Validity):**
*   **Real Counting vs. Guessing:** WGS measures the actual mutation load across 3,000 Mb (or the full ~30-50 Mb exome coding region) rather than extrapolating from a small slice.
*   **Lower Concordance Variance:** WGS provides the definitive TMB score, reducing "gray zone" misclassifications that deny patients therapy or cause unnecessary treatment.
