# Appendix 1: The "98% Nuance" (WGS vs. WES for TMB)

## 1. The "98%" Figure
*   **What it means:** The *correlation* coefficient between WES and WGS is **~0.98**. This means they track very closely.
*   **The Interpretation:** WES is excellent. It is the **Research Gold Standard**. In terms of *pure TMB counting*, WES is 98% as good as WGS.

## 2. So... Why WGS?
If WES is 98% good at TMB, why buy WGS?

### Reason A: The "Gray Zone" (The 2% matters)
In samples with **low tumor purity** (e.g., 20%), WES "capture probes" can fail to catch enough DNA, leading to drop-outs. WGS doesn't use probes, so it's more robust in these difficult samples.

### Reason B: The Real Enemy is Panels
Your market competitor is **NOT WES**; it is **Panels** (Foundation/Caris).
*   Panels have a **~20% error rate** (misclassification) compared to WGS/WES.
*   WES is the "Truth" that proves Panels are wrong. WGS is just the *perfected* version of that Truth.

## 3. Strategic Takeaway
*   **Don't** build your whole pitch on "WGS TMB vs. WES TMB" (The gap is small: ~2%).
*   **DO** build your pitch on "WGS TMB vs. Panel TMB" (The gap is huge: ~20%).
